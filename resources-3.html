                        <p class="card-subtext">Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself.</p>

                        <p class="card-subtext">When dealing with someone who has depression the key is to listen to the person who is suffering, keep them creative and constantly stimulated.

                        <p class="card-subtext">Depression can affect people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and genders. Women are diagnosed with depression more often than men, but men can also be depressed. Because men may be less likely to recognize, talk about, and seek help for their feelings or emotional problems, they are at greater risk of their depression symptoms being undiagnosed or undertreated. Studies also show higher rates of depression and an increased risk for the disorder among members of the LGBTQI+ community.</p>
